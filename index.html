                    <h2>What do they look like</h2>

                    <p>
                        Mushies are a type of spider with fungal growth growing out of it a lot isn't know a bout them except the basic things about it like the mantis claws and abundance of fur and they are the size of a big dog.

                    <h2>Where do they live</h2>

                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They live on the planet absolone (planet a) wich is an entirely dark planet mostly filled with caves and mushrooms the only animals on there are the big cats, fish, giant mushrooms, and giant mushrooms also with the mushies.
                        
                        
                    </p>

                    <h2>How they survive</h2>

                    <p>
                        They are a competing predator with the big cats the top predators there are no other predator for them. They are blind though so they rely on there hearing and sense of smellthats because of the mushrooms growing out of their bodys. But the mushrooms help it in other ways like coating the spider venom with a fungal growth wich will likely effect the animal behaviour. Or the fact in cold they will start to harden there body to keep their temprature warm and to help the mushrooms go around the spider making a type of coat around them. They make webs on top of the large mushrooms making a type of hammock of sorts, also before i forget they have mantis claws when the animal is affected by the spore it will use it claw to kill it quickly.
                        
                        
                        
                    </p>

                    <h2>To sum it up</h2>
                    <p>Mushies are an incredible species of spider found on [PlanetName]. They have the unique ability to grow mushrooms on their backs, making them a valuable and intriguing member of the arachnid family. Mushies can be found in a variety of dark and damp caves on virtually anywhere on [PlanetName]. They prefer to settle in these cold and damp environments due to their sensitivity to heat and light. Mushies can be quite friendly when approached properly and can even make for excellent pets. Despite their small size, these little creatures have a big appetite and prefer to feed on insects and other small animals. They are an incredibly fascinating species and offer an incredible insight into the natural world.</p>
